- 👋 Hi, I’m Fernando Schuh
- 👀 I’m interested in R and Python, integrating analysis with Google Earth Engine and easing my everyday work with QGIS and ArcGIS.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, but have developed many reports and documents in general doing data analysis with R-tidyverse.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Python-GEE integrated routines, helping to stop people clicking so much buttons on QGIS/ArcGIS.
- 📫 How to reach me: my personal e-mail is frorigf@gmail.com
